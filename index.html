I am a 19 year old undergraduate from Minneapolis, I have a passion for solving problems and challenging myself. 
    Technoglogy has always intrigued me ever since I was a child. Watching the world rapidly advance as I got older made me question how things worked.
    This gave me the window into the world of computer science where I wish to hone my skills and learn to develop the technology of the future.</p>
